Please complete the following tasks:

- give me a short explanation of what the code actually does.
- there are a coulpe of errors that will stop the code from executing, find and fix them. 
- refactor the code by by ensuring the functionality is not changed. 
- create a git repository containing the initial files and do regular
  and small commits to log your process.
- send me your git bundle containing your changes.

*Note - The code is not supposed to be working and executing, the idea here is to review it, make suggestions and fix some visible errors.
